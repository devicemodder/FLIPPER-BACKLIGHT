# FLIPPER-BACKLIGHT
Needed to fix the busted backlight in my flipper after a failed RGB mod
This board came about when i tried and failed to do the RGB mod to the flipper zero. I needed a new backlight PCB as the original snapped in half during removal. so, i made a new one. 

All parts are 0603 SMD, and the LEDS can be whatever color you want to solder on. this is a SINGLE COLOR backlight and is intended as a replacement for the original flipper backlight PCB. 

the files in this In this repo are an eagle .brd file for the PCB, and a zip with gerber files that can be sent directly to your favourite PCB fab house. (I ised JLCPCB). PCB thickness is 0.6mm, double layer. installation is very straightforward.
ie, the reverse of removing the original backlight.
